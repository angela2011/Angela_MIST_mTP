# HTTP - IP restriction bypass
## Procedure:
- In the description of the question, we find out that "Only local users will be able to access the page".
- Upon starting the challenge, we notice that it mentions which network address the user is part of but mentions that we are not part of the lAN. For this we use an external tool like Burp SUite.
- We launch the same challenge on chromium and intercept it using Burp Suite.
- Now, on reading the reference material provided in the challenge, we come across this:

- The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the
   following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets:

     10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)

- So now we know we ned to change the network address to 10.0.0.0 in order to be part of the LAN.
### Steps to change network address:
1. Go to the match and replace tab and click on add
2. Replace the address with X-Forwarder-For: 10.0.0.0 and add a comment like new address.
3. Check if it is ticked under the proxy settings tab.
4. Refresh the page and forward all requests to finally get the flag on the webpage.
