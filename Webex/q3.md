# HTTP - Open redirect
## Procedure:
- We are led to a webpage where we can open any 3 of these applications: Twitter, Facebook or slack.
- To retrieve the flag, we need to redirect to another application by interceptiong through a tool like Burp Suite.
- After turning the intercept on, we change the request to another application say Youtube and forward it.
- We notice the webpage displays something like "Incorrect Hash!"
- so we check for the type of hash which is MD5 and ecode https://youtube.com in MD5 and paste it before forwarding the request thim time.
- Voila, the flag is displayed on the webpage!
