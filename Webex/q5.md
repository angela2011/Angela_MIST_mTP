# Directory indexing
## Procedure:
- Once the webpage is inspected, we find a comment that says include /admin/pass.html (Only to find out I got rickrolled)
- But since the name of the challenge is directory indexing I checked only the /admin directory and found out that there's another sub directory called /backup
- Once we enter that diectory and enter the correct file we find that the password is LINUX
- Burpsuite isn't required for this challengeas we only need to check inside the directories.
