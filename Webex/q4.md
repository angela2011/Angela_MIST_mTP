# HTTP - User-agent
## Procedure:
- After starting the challenge we notice the webpage displays something along the lines- User agent isn't "admin".
- So now whhen we intersept using Burpsuite, we replace the Mozilla firefox User agent to just be admin and forward the request to finally get the flag
- This is a relatively easy challenge so this is all I can write
