# Spiral Cipher
- cipher: taskphaWL_PL4sOingpYefdngaP{_diddL40ap}y5rn_s1m37
## Procedure:
- First we count the total number of charaters in the given cipher string which is equal to 49.
- Next we arrange it in a 7*7 matrix as 7^2=49.
- Now we write down the decoded string by going in a spiral i.e Start reading from the left of the first row then go down the last column then right to left of the last row and then up through the first column until the second last element as that has already been covered while traversing the first row.
- Similarly, we go from the left to the right of the second row until the second last element and so on in a spiral pattern to finally get the flag.
- Final decoded string: taskphaWL_PL4sOingpYefdngaP{_diddL40ap}y5rn_s1m37
